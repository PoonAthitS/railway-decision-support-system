## 1. Introduction
Since the COVID-19 pandemic-related travel restrictions were lifted, public transportation needs have returned to normal levels. Numerous surges in demand for travel, particularly during peak hours such as concerts and festivals, have caused train operating compananies some concerns about their route arrangement. This sparked my interest to develop this project which introduces the Railway Decision Support System (RDSS) to assist route managers in determining the best strategy for sending trains through each railway segment. It can provide details of railway segment planning by determining the maximum number of trains that can be sent from one origin to one destination using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, represented in its user-friendly functions within an Excel. 

## 2. Functions

All of the RDSS's functions are purposefully concentrated on the "Decision Support System" tab, which contains five commands.
